# Flittig Student 
#### Group project for Dat251 - Modern Software Development
For this project we created an app to motivate students at Universities here in Norway to physically attend school after a long time dealing with online teaching.
After sitting at home with online courses many students are stuck in their old ways and find it hard to reak their habits and get back to physically attend school.
By creating our prototype Flitting Student, a mobile application, we intend to motivate students to go to school. Another goal is also to learn good Agile practise with development using varius Scum and XP practices.

## Project Description
**Flittig Student** hopes to motivate student by them gathering points by physically attending school. These points can be used to redeem prizes found in the application. Users can also compete with their friends on who has the most points gathered in total. The application uses Google login and checks the users location and sees if their actually at school. If they are a timer, a motivational quote and how many points you gather come up intended to motivate the student. The points are earned by physically attending school and increase every half hour the user is at school.  

To create our application we used **Firebase** and **Android Studio** with **Java**.  

This is only an MVP version of our idea but we also have hope for some future features:
* Timetable so that the student can keep track of their day
* Check which other students are at school  

The challanges we faced:  

## How to install and run the application

## How to use the application
